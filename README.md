# Pitching-R-Shiny-App
The code to run a pitching shiny app using trackman data.

The file in this repository contains the code for my pitching shiny app while I was with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks in the Cape League.

The file contains comments that should do a thorough job explaining the code.

If you have any questions, comments, or make some use of the code please reach out to me on twitter. My handle is gabe_appelbaum and I would love to hear from you!
