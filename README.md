# Pitching-R-Shiny-App
The code to run a pitching shiny app using trackman data.

The file in this repository contains the code for my pitching shiny app while I was with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks in the Cape League.

The file contains comments that should do a thorough job explaining the code. 

**Please read the comments!!! ** Especially the sections about loading the data and creating the PitchType column

If you have any questions, comments, or make some use of the code please reach out to me on twitter. My handle is gabe_appelbaum and I would love to hear from you!
